# Tenzies Game

This is a project from Scrimba Free React course, a really good project, where I practice most react fundamentals and advanced topics, and I really enjoy it.

## The game
It's simple. the user need to choose a number from the dices provided, they can click the roll button if they don't like the random generated values at any time, and then they start selecting the value they choose, every selected dice, will not change when the user roll again, until the user select all dices, and all dices has the same value, then the user win, after winning the game, they can reset it, and play again.
